# Sketch Detection

This repository contains a Pytorch model for original dataset and Google's quickdraw dataset to detect sketches.

## Dataset

I used original datasets and a subset from [Google's quickdraw dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) which contains more than 50 million drawings across 345 categories and original dataset.
